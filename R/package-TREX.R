#' @description
#'
#' Performs data assimilation, processing and analyses on sap flow data obtained with the thermal dissipation method (TDM).
#' The package includes functions for gap filling time-series data, detecting outliers, calculating data-processing uncertainties and,
#' generating uniform data output and visualisation. The package is designed to deal with large quantities of data and apply commonly
#' used data-processing methods. The functions have been validated on data collected from different tree species across the northern hemisphere
#' (Peters et al. 2018 <doi: 10.1111/nph.15241>).
